# My first JS calculator

Hi, welcome to my JS calculator...

I got the idea from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98), but improved it a bit...

## How it works?

Every time the user presses a number key, the JS script will check if the current input is a calc using regex...

You can check it out [here](https://pedromarquetti.github.io/calculator/)
